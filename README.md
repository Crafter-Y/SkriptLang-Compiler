# SkriptLang-Compiler
This project aims to compile the "code" files designed for the Minecraft Plugin [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) into a Java Paper Plugin. I know that I will never completely implement the Skript specifications und I also know that I will definitely overengineer some parts of my application. It's fine, this is just a side Project, that I can get distracted with.
